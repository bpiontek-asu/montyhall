# montyhall
This package provides each of the functions needed to play the Monty Hall Problem game in the scenario where there are three doors, two with goats behind them and one with a car. In this version of the game, the contestant selects a door (by number) and the the host opens on of the two remaining doors, which has a goat behind it. This allows the contestant the opportunity to choose between staying with the door they originally selected, or switching to the other remaining unopened door. Once the contestant decides on their strategy (stay or switch) the package can indicate whether they will win (choose the door with the car behind it) or lose (choose a door with a goat behind it) the game. In addition to providing each of the individual functions needed to play the Monty Hall game, the package provides a wrapped function allowing for the entire game to be played with the use of that single function. Further, it provides a function to allow the game to be played on a loop, so that the game runner can determine the frequency of a given outcome (win/lose) for each game strategy (stay/switch).
