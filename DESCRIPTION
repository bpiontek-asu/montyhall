Description: This package provides each of the functions needed to play the 
    Monty Hall Problem game in the scenario where there are three doors, two 
    with goats behind them and one with a car. In this version of the game, the
    contestant selects a door (by number) and the the host opens on of the two 
    remaining doors, which has a goat behind it. This allows the contestant the 
    opportunity to choose between staying with the door they originally 
    selected, or switching to the other remaining unopened door. Once the 
    contestant decides on their strategy (stay or switch) the package can 
    indicate whether they will win (choose the door with the car behind it) or 
    lose (choose a door with a goat behind it) the game. In addition to 
    providing each of the individual functions needed to play the Monty Hall 
    game, the package provides a wrapped function allowing for the entire game
    to be played with the use of that single function. Further, it provides a 
    function to allow the game to be played on a loop, so that the game runner
    can determine the frequency of a given outcome (win/lose) for each game 
    strategy (stay/switch).
